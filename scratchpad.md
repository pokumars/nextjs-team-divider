validation for number of teams
- num of teams cant exceed num of players
- OPTIONAL- e.g. if there are supposed to be 5 teams of 2 but only 7 players then some kinda math that makes everyon into 2 teams with most/all being in more than 1 team. Perhaps by duplicating everyone so that they show up 2x in the array.


NB: if you have only 1 player for some skill leves, there is a high likelyhood that the randomness will not have any effect on them.
